### Meet your online digital Ladybug for companionship & debugging -- LadeBug! 

A chrome extension to overlay a tiny, adorable ladybug, as a digital companion during debugging and general development work. Why? 'cause who doesn't want a cute ladybug on their browser.



-----------------------



Meet **LadeBug**, your adorable digital companion whom you can talk to, and debug with. 

In addition to hanging around, LadeBug is also responsible enough to set 15 minute alarms, should you want a short break soon, and not lose track of time.

LadeBug is working on her memory and remembers the links to developer-friendly sites like StackOverflow, GitHub, Reddit and CodePen.

LadeBug is also fairly shy, so don't try touching her with the mouse pointer or he may try dodging you. :wink:
